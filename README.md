My third OpenGL renderer rewrite written in C for a more data orientated design approach. This renderer will include the features from my past ones. 
This is an educational project for my inevitable transfer into vulkan.

Current Features:
-Free Camera
-Read Shader from file
-IMGUI Support
-Multi Mesh Model Loading

and more to be added :^)
